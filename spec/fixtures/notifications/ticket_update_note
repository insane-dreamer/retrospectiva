  Try to change

  {{{ @@gc_count = (@@gc_count + 1) % 20 }}}

  to a lower value, eg:

  {{{ @@gc_count = (@@gc_count + 1) % 10 }}}

  This should slow-down your memory growth (and the SVN processing
  speed :-().

  Yes, this is the expected behaviour when you are working with with
  SVN repositories. Retrospectiva (as a typical RubyOnRails
  application) uses ~40M of RAM, the rest is consumed by the Ruby-SVN
  bindings (for various reasons). The memory consumption is directly
  proportional to the size of your repository, but your demand of
  ~100M of RAM seems quite reasonable to me.

  Donâ€™t worry, the memory allocation will not continue growing.
